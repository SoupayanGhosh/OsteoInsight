# OsteoInsight: Data-Driven Osteoporosis Research

Welcome to **OsteoInsight**, a comprehensive research project leveraging data science to uncover insights into osteoporosis‚Äîa condition characterized by weakened bones and increased fracture risk. This project utilizes real-world data to explore, analyze, and model factors contributing to osteoporosis, with the goal of supporting early detection and informed healthcare decisions.

---

## üìä Dataset Overview

The project is powered by the `osteoporosisfinal.csv` dataset, which contains anonymized patient records and clinical features relevant to osteoporosis. The dataset includes variables such as:

- **Demographic Information:** Age, gender, etc.
- **Clinical Measurements:** Bone mineral density, calcium levels, vitamin D, etc.
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Physical activity, dietary habits, smoking status, etc.
- **Medical History:** Family history, previous fractures, comorbidities, etc.

*Note: All data is used strictly for research and educational purposes.*

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Uncover patterns and trends in osteoporosis-related factors.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Identify significant predictors and correlations.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict osteoporosis risk.
- **Visualization:** Present findings through clear, informative charts and graphs.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide recommendations for early intervention and risk reduction.
